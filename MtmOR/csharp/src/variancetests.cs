        Two-sample F-test

        This test checks three hypotheses about dispersions of the given  samples.
        The following tests are performed:
            * two-tailed test (null hypothesis - the dispersions are equal)
            * left-tailed test (null hypothesis  -  the  dispersion  of  the first
              sample is greater than or equal to  the  dispersion  of  the  second
              sample).
            * right-tailed test (null hypothesis - the  dispersion  of  the  first
              sample is less than or equal to the dispersion of the second sample)

        The test is based on the following assumptions:
            * the given samples have normal distributions
            * the samples are independent.

        Input parameters:
            X   -   sample 1. Array whose index goes from 0 to N-1.
            N   -   sample size.
            Y   -   sample 2. Array whose index goes from 0 to M-1.
            M   -   sample size.

        Output parameters:
            BothTails   -   p-value for two-tailed test.
                            If BothTails is less than the given significance level
                            the null hypothesis is rejected.
            LeftTail    -   p-value for left-tailed test.
                            If LeftTail is less than the given significance level,
                            the null hypothesis is rejected.
            RightTail   -   p-value for right-tailed test.
                            If RightTail is less than the given significance level
                            the null hypothesis is rejected.
